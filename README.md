# tcOS README
I am learning Nix. Do not use my configs, they are likey garbage lol

## TODO:
* Set up Plasma Manager to save the way I configured KDE (tbh: I don't like KDE very much)
* Set up Hyperland or Niri with Waybar, etc in the way I like (tbh: I want to be able to go back to classic DE when I want a break from tiling managers)
* Set up Gnome in the way I like
* Set up neovim
* Set up keybindings across the board
* ???
* $$$
